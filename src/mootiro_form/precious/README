This is a database migration repository.

To start using sqlalchemy-migrate on an existing database, issue this command:

    migrate version_control URL REPOSITORY_PATH [VERSION]

...where URL is your SQLAlchemy connection string,
REPOSITORY_PATH is the directory where manage.py is,
and VERSION is the current database version number, higher than zero.

A very similar command upgrades to the latest database version:

    migrate upgrade URL REPOSITORY_PATH
